Sunshine
========

Sunshine is the companion Android app for the Udacity course [Developing Android Apps: Android Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853).

Take the course to find out how to build this app a step at a time, and eventually create your own Android App!

This is the second version of the Sunshine code. The repository has been updated cause of the used remote web service has changed their usage policy:

### Open Weather Map API Key is required.

I recommend that to obtain a key via the following [instructions](http://openweathermap.org/appid#use), and include the unique key for the build by adding the following line to [USER_HOME]/.gradle/gradle.properties

`MyOpenWeatherMapApiKey="<UNIQUE_API_KEY">`
